				<h1>Moe in the 90s</h1>
				<h3>Turnover</h3>
				<p>
					The 90s was the last flush of originality before the 2000s, and it 
					also brought along digital animation, which increased the amount of anime 
					produced dramatically by the ease at which animation could be made now. 
					It was also in this decade that anime became more prevalent outside of 
					Japan, with shows like <cite>Dragon Ball Z</cite> breaking records of 
					animation produced by even Disney. 
					<br><br>
					With the term "moe" coming in full swing, it became more evident the animators 
					are getting very good at animating, so the cuteness of the characters improves 
					drastically. 
					<br><br>
					The most popular anime of the 90s include:
				</p>

				<img src="sailor.jpg" alt="Sailor_Moon" height="400">
				<img src="poke.jpg" alt="Pokemon" height="400">
				<p>
					(From left to right) The anime being: <cite>Cowboy Bebop</cite>, 
					<cite>Sailor Moon</cite> and <cite>Pokemon</cite>.
					<br><br>
					First, in the anime <cite>Cowboy Bebop</cite>, We reach a contrast, 
					the creator Shinchiro Watanabe, created two characters to contrast 
					each other. The first one being the stunning Faye Valentine, a 
					tricky beautiful woman that has high resemblance to Fujiko Mine from 
					back in the 70s. The other being a young girl named Ed, who is wacky 
					but a braniac and a hacker. The characters encompassing both pre-moe 
					and post-moe as a perfect contrast.
				</p>

				<p>
					Second, <cite>Sailor Moon</cite>, like <cite>Dragon Ball Z</cite>, 
					<cite>Sailor Mooon</cite> is massively popular anime that aired in the 
					90s and is known far and wide, even to those that aren't anime fans. 
					The is a romance to peak the interest of females, but it was initially 
					made to try to get males to watch more anime like it by adding in a weekly
					enemy battle formula, like they did in anime like <cite>Fist of the North Star</cite>.
					Each girls was drawn very cutely, and each girl is popular on their own, even without 
					referancing the source.
				</p>
				<img src="Usagi_Tsukino.jpg" alt="Rabbit" height="200">
				<p>
					Third, <cite>Pokemon</cite>, who doesn't know <cite>Pokemon</cite>? It is one of the most 
					successful gaming franchise, and a popular anime that airs every saturday in 
					America and Japan. While there were girls in <cite>Pokemon</cite>, the moe in the anime 
					that was the most popular was actually the <cite>Pokemon</cite> themselves. The cuteness 
					of the drawings was easier to use to draw in both males and females, unlike monsters from 
					the 80s and 70s. It was with this anime, that monsters in anime would start to look more cute.
