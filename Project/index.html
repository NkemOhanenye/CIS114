					Moe in anime has been around for a long period of time. This is a site 
					dedicated to explain the effects that moe has had on the state of the 
					anime community, from the creators to the fans. But first, what is moe?
					<br><br>
					Moe is a term coined by anime fans in Japan in the 80s, that refers to the 
					strong feelings of affection toward a character (usually female) in anime, manga, 
					video games, etc. The word comes from the Japanese word "Moeru (萌える)" which 
					means "to be infactuated". 
					<br><br>
					Some of you may be wondering as to why the dates start from the 70s; the 
					reason of this decision lies in that while "modern anime" started back in 
					the 60s with Tezuka Osamu's <cite>Tetsuwan no Atom (Astro Boy)</cite>, the 
					aspects that really made moe come to be began in the 70s, so there was no 
					reason to bring up the discussion before then.
					<br><br>
					The following example was made by a fan in showing how anime styles has 
					changed since the 90s.
