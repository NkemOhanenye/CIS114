				<h1>Moe in the 70s</h1>
				<h3>When it Began</h3>
				<p>
					It has been a decade into anime so what's cool nowadays? 
					Well, various things actually; from slice of life comedy anime 
					to dramatic sports anime, there were so many to choose from! 
					...Well, not quite, while there were many anime that aired during 
					the times, the real limit was animation. Cel animation was very 
					difficult to do, and very time consuming. Most studios would dedicate 
					themselves to create one anime for a long period of time, then when the 
					story finally ends, they start the next one on their bucket list.
					<br><br>
					The following images are of the most popular anime of the time:

				<p>
					(From left to right) The anime being: <cite>Lupin III</cite>, 
					<cite>The Rose of Versailles</cite> and <cite>Mobile Suit Gundam</cite>.
					<br><br>
					First, in the anime <cite>Lupin III</cite>, we are shown the one of the first 
					beautiful woman in anime who is loved by males, and aspiration of woman in 
					Japan, Fujiko Mine. She was seen as a great woman, but not really similar to 
					how moe is today.
				</p>

				<p>
					Second, in the anime <cite>The Rose of Versailles</cite>, Oscar is a 
					strong woman who was raised as a boy and becomres the love interest of the men 
					that serves and got to know her. While charming in her own right, she also does 
					not fit the mold of moe. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Third, in the anime <cite>Mobile Suit Gundam</cite>, we are thrown in a giant war that 
					lasts an entire year, and our main characters are civilians who are made to fight 
					and help end the war. Not only men, but woman are also fighting in the war, to show
					the importance of man power over gender. Similarly to both <cite>Lupin III</cite> and 
					<abbr>Versailles</abbr>, the woman are strong, however, to show realism in the anime 
					Yoshiyuki Tomino, the director and creator of <abbr>Gundam</abbr>, added in scenes of 
					bathing, which after finding many screen captures of the woman of <abbr>Gundam</abbr>, 
					studios began to add more attractive females inside battle anime.
